*API from [RapidApi](https://rapidapi.com), exactly [IP Geolocation and Threat Detection](https://rapidapi.com/ipregistry3-ipregistry/api/ip-geolocation-and-threat-detection/) for its main functions.
On the other hand, for the UI, the framework [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/) was used in conjunction with its [script for modal](https://github.com/picocss/pico/blob/master/docs/js/modal.js).
As for the main script, it was developed purely with [javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) applying fetch for the use of the endpoints provided by the API.*
